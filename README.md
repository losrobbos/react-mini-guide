# React Projects

In this folder please find React mini projects, demonstrating React concepts

## Abbreviations & Terms for Web Projects

### Asset

A file in our project, e.g. JavaScript, CSS or Image, that potentially can get optimized before shipping.

E.g. CSS "assets" can be optimized for shipping, by merging them all together into ONE CSS file and "minify" them (=> compacting the resulting CSS file, e.g. by removing all whitespaces / newlines)

### Bundler

An applicaton that merges javascript & other assets like CSS files together and optimizes them (e.g. reduce filesize so the assets load as quickly as possible in the browser)

### Build process

The process that triggers the bundling & optimization. The result is usually a folder called "build" or "dist" (= distribution => optimized for distributing / deployment)

The resulting "build" folder can be deployed to any free or paid hoster easily, e.g. GitHub pages, Netlify, Vercel or Heroku

### Webpack

A famous bundler application for web projects. De facto standard of the past (gets more and more competition)

### Dev Server

A program that will launch your web project in the browser. Typically listens for your code changes and updates the code in the browser automatically, without a need to refresh.

Typical examples: 
- Live-Server
- the Webpack dev server

You use the dev server ONLY (!) during local development. The Dev Server starts your app, but does not optimize it for release.

Once you are satisfied and reached a state that is worth RELEASING, you will BUILD the web project (=optimize the assets) and deploy the optimized BUILD.

### CRA => Create-React-App

An NPM package which will create a react project using the bundler "Webpack". It will already setup a boilerplate for your project and a pre-configured "build process". 

So ideally - for basic projects - you just need to start the build process and can deploy the resulting "build" folder to any host provider, e.g. Vercel.

The package Create-React-App was created and is maintained by Facebook / Meta.

#### Problems

Creat-React-App creates a pretty bloated react project with several hundred NPM packages it depends on. 

So the setup & install process for even a super basic web project is quite huge. 

Also starting up a CRA project takes a considerable amount of time, due it starts the webpack dev server, which is quite slow.

And due you have all this hundreds of dependencies, you can easily get into issues once any of these dependencies gets updated. Maybe this single package contains a bug or has again NEW dependencies with other packages, which could break the whole react app from even starting up.


### Vite

An alternative to the CRA build tool which uses "esbuild" under the hood for bundling instead of webpack. 

Esbuild is significantly faster compared to the WebPack bundler.

Vite installs just the bare, necessary packages to get React up and running.

Also you can setup not just React projects with it, also vanilla JS web projects or VueJS projects.

This package is maintained by the VueJS community

#### Problems

Vite gets you up and running quickly and the initial experience is great.

However: A lot of react specific NPM packages rely on the full blown setup of CRA.

So in short: Quite some packages will not work with your Vite setup right away and you sometimes need to install the necessary packages that it depends on manually.



## Fundamental REACT Concepts

### Component

A reusable "lego" piece in your website, e.g. a header, including its layout, style and javascript logic

### JSX

JSX (JavaScript XML) is kind of a mixture between HTML and JavaScript data.

The use case for JSX is to get reusable layouts, where you can fill in different data.

You can write an "HTML layout" once, and reuse it throughout your application.

JSX is comparable to a javascript function that RETURNS HTML at the end, but different HTML depending on the INPUT variables. 

Different input variables => <b>same LAYOUT & STYLE, but different CONTENT</b>. 

This way you can e.g. create a list of todo cards, each having the same layout & style, but each having different content in the card.


### Props

Props are for components what parameters are for functions. 

You use props to give some INPUT to your component. 

Usually props are used to pass in DATA that should get rendered into an existing HTML layout.

E.g. you have a reusable "UserCard" component that should render the SAME layout, but each time with different DATA.

So you setup the layout in the component UserCard using JSX.

And you pass in the actual DATA that should get displayed, using PROPS

Example: 


```
const user = { name: "Rob", age: 38 }

// Passing user data as PROP
return (
	<UserCard user={ user } />
)
```

```
// UserCard component

// receiving the data
const UserCard = ( { name, age } ) => {

	// JSX => LAYOUT of our component ! But with changeable content! 
	return <div>{name} is {age} years old</div>

}
```


### Rendering

The process where React updates the DOM (the visible stuff in the browser)

Typically this is triggered by some USER ACTION, e.g. the user filtering a list or adding a new item.

The RENDERING is done by React automatically, whenever there is some NEW / UPDATED data to render.

And the thing that TRIGGERS this rendering process is the so called STATE...


### State

STATE is any data that could get UPDATED in the UI.

State is data that will change based on USER ACTION.

E.g. the user creates a new item in the UI (whatever item that is) by clicking some button.

In React we will NOT update the DOM directly with JavaScript. It will do that work for us.

Instead we will change a so called STATE variable, using a SETTER function. 

By calling this SETTER function, React will automatically (!) - in the background so to say - update the DOM for us! So it will do all the magic of "document.querySelector" and DOM update logic for us. 

Example: 
`const [user, setUser] = useState( { name: "Rob", age: 38  } )` 

In this case "user" is the STATE VARIABLE. "setUser" is the SETTER function.

We can use this setter function to UPDATE the user object. 

`setUser({...user, age: 39}) // set a new age on the user object`

Once the SETTER function updated the object, React will now trigger the UPDATE of the DOM auto-magically behind the scenes.

It will also do it very efficient. Meaning: It will just update the DOM in that parts that actually have changed, and will leave everything else untouched!

The concept of state is a very universal and CENTRAL concept in Frontend Frameworks these days.

So learn it once, and you will have a solid foundation for modern web programming!
